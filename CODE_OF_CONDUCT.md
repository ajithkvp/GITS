### Code of Conduct for Contributors
## Our Commitment
With the aim of nurturing an open and inclusive environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to making engagement in our project and community a welcoming experience for all, regardless of age, body type, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Guidelines
We encourage behaviors that contribute to a positive environment, such as:

Using language that is welcoming and inclusive.
Respecting diverse viewpoints and experiences.
Accepting constructive criticism with grace.
Prioritizing the best interests of the community.
Demonstrating empathy toward other community members.
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
Trolling, making insulting or derogatory comments, and engaging in personal or political attacks.
Harassment, whether public or private.
Disclosure of others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for defining the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and equitable corrective actions in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the authority and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not adhere to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Applicability
This Code of Conduct is applicable both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or serving as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. The representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at tagrawa3@ncsu.edu. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and appropriate and necessary actions will be taken based on the circumstances. The project team is bound to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be detailed in separate documents.

Project maintainers who fail to adhere to or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences, as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
